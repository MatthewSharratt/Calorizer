# Calorizer
Calorizer is a compact WinForms app for tracking calories over the course of the day. It is designed to be left open, so it does not save or load.

By opening Calorizer.exe.config you can customize the following without having to modify the code:
Application background color, UI background color, text color, the text for calories in, the text for calories out, and the text for calories total
